This semester, the computer science class had six units, from basic tools such as strings, creating lists, dictionaries, and using loops, to writing functions and incorporating different functions into solving practical problems. The curriculum was getting more and more challenging throughout the semster. Jason gets for their final grade, 90, which converts to A-. Well-done!

Jason performs well in tests! They got a 91.5 overall.It seems that they are doing ok in their problem sets.Also, we did some partner projects, Jason are doing great overall! We are proud that they enjoyed doing the project!

Jason is an effective and active collaborator this semester, and I think they should continue to use this skill to help him with challenging questions before asking for guidance. Through our observation, They are struggling to complete their work on time, as well as taking on challenge to write code creatively. Jason has little trouble asking questions in class when we explain certain concepts, but if needed they should not be afraid to seek individual help. We are always willing to support our students in any way we can. Jason has taken initiative throughout the semester to work through difficulties in code. Jason should know that it is okay to talk to us if things are taking a longer time than anticipated.

We are pleased to see Jasonâ€™s progress this semester! Jason listened carefully in class, seeked help when they needed it. Although Jason said they struggled in the beginning, we were glad that they caught up quickly. Jason is such a creative coder that they use an innovative approach in their second project that printed the expected results in succinct codes.As Jason's teachers, we really enjoyed having them as part of our computer science class. Good luck in their other academics!

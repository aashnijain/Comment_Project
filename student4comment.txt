This semester, the computer science class had six units, from basic tools such as strings, creating lists, dictionaries, and using loops, to writing functions and incorporating different functions into solving practical problems. The curriculum was getting more and more challenging throughout the semster. Elizabeth gets for her final grade, 86.625, which converts to B. We can see her efforts.

It seems that Elizabeth is doing ok in tests. She got a 85.5 overall.It seems that she is doing ok in her problem sets.Also, we did some partner projects, Elizabeth is doing ok overall. We hope to see more communications in her collaboration with her partner.

Elizabeth has been a very quiet student in our class this year. Often, she seems to work alone and we think that working more with her peers on questions that seem hard would help her to excel in this class. Through our observation, She is struggling to complete her work on time, as well as taking on challenge to write code creatively. Elizabeth has no trouble asking for help when she gets stuck on something. We want to support all our students as teachers, and she has demonstrated clearly that she will use us as guides after having attempted on her own. Elizabeth has been very intentional throughout this semester in identifying challenges and finding unique ways to overcome them.

Elizabeth is a hard-worker. Being one of the few sophomores in class, she is a relatively quiet but respectful listener in class. Her works impressed us by how well she could combine knowledge from different units together!As Elizabeth's teachers, we really enjoyed having her as part of our computer science class. Good luck in her other academics!

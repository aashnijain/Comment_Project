This semester, the computer science class had six units, from basic tools such as strings, creating lists, dictionaries, and using loops, to writing functions and incorporating different functions into solving practical problems. The curriculum was getting more and more challenging throughout the semster. Jack gets for his final grade, 79.75, which converts to C+. He did try.

Jack tries but struggles a bit in tests. He got a 69 overall. In particular, the score 68 made us concern.It seems that he might need more help in his problem sets.Also, we did some partner projects, Jack should take on more responsibility. Relying on others is not a good habit in improving his skills.

Jack has been a very quiet student in our class this year. Often, he seems to work alone and we think that working more with his peers on questions that seem hard would help him to excel in this class. Through our observation, He is struggling to complete his work on time, as well as taking on challenge to write code creatively. Jack has little trouble asking questions in class when we explain certain concepts, but if needed he should not be afraid to seek individual help. We are always willing to support our students in any way we can. Jack has been very intentional throughout this semester in identifying challenges and finding unique ways to overcome them.

Unlike his other classmates, Jack had very little knowledge in coding coming in class. Regarding the curriculum is getting more challenging toward the end of the year, we are glad to see Jackâ€™s improvement throughout the semester. Although due to his schedule, Jack will not continue learning computer science next spring, we hope he can keep the positivity in all his academics!As Jack's teachers, we really enjoyed having him as part of our computer science class. Good luck in his other academics!

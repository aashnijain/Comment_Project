This semester, the computer science class had six units, from basic tools such as strings, creating lists, dictionaries, and using loops, to writing functions and incorporating different functions into solving practical problems. The curriculum was getting more and more challenging throughout the semster. Lauren gets for her final grade, 95.875, which coverts to A. Congrats! We are so proud for her!

Lauren is doing superb in tests!  She got a 96.5 overall!It seems that she did stellar work in her problem sets.Also, we did some partner projects, Lauren collaborates so well! She is definetely a helpful partner!

Lauren is excellent at collaborating with her peers by brainstorming and discussing with them before asking for help from us. She is a focused and diligent worker. Her attention to detail and drive to write code creatively has made her stand out as a strong student in this class so far. Lauren has no trouble asking for help when she gets stuck on something. We want to support all our students as teachers, and she has demonstrated clearly that she will use us as guides after having attempted on her own. Lauren has been very intentional throughout this semester in identifying challenges and finding unique ways to overcome them.

Her science research project about new ways of training neural networks shows her deep understanding in machine learning. We really enjoy having her this semester! Hope she will continue pursuing her passion in computer science in college!As Lauren's teachers, we really enjoyed having her as part of our computer science class. Good luck in her other academics!
